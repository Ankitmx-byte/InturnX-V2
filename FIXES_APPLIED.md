# Landing Page and Login Issues - FIXED ✅

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Landing Page Not Showing (Redirecting to Login)
**Problem:** The Home component (landing page) was wrapped in a `ProtectedRoute`, requiring authentication to view it.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the `ProtectedRoute` wrapper from the Home component in `App.jsx`
- Made the landing page (`/`) publicly accessible
- Added logic to redirect authenticated users from Home to Dashboard automatically

**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/App.jsx` - Made `/` route public
- `client/src/components/Home.jsx` - Added redirect logic for authenticated users

### Issue 2: Login Failed (API Connection Issues)
**Problem:** 
- Backend server was running on a random port (54112) instead of the configured port
- Windows reserves ports 5000-5004 for system use, causing port conflicts
- Vite proxy was configured for port 5000, but server couldn't bind to it

**Solution:**
- Changed backend port from 5000 to 5001 in `.env` file
- Updated Vite proxy configuration to point to port 5001
- Server now starts successfully on the configured port

**Files Changed:**
- `server/.env` - Changed PORT from 5000 to 5001
- `client/vite.config.js` - Updated proxy target to http://localhost:5001

## Current Setup

### Backend Server
- **Port:** 5001
- **URL:** http://localhost:5001
- **Status:** ✅ Running
- **Database:** MongoDB connected successfully

### Frontend Client
- **Port:** 5173
- **URL:** http://localhost:5173
- **Status:** ✅ Running
- **Proxy:** All `/api/*` requests forwarded to backend at port 5001

## How to Access

1. **Landing Page:** http://localhost:5173/
   - Now publicly accessible without login
   - Shows all features, stats, and information about InturnX

2. **Login Page:** http://localhost:5173/login
   - Demo credentials pre-filled
   - Email: demo@inturnx.com
   - Password: demo123

3. **Quick Demo Login:** Click "Try Demo" button on landing page or "Quick Demo Login" on login page

## Testing the Fix

1. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser
2. You should see the landing page with:
   - Hero section with "Master Coding with AI Intelligence"
   - Stats section
   - Features showcase
   - "Start Your Journey", "Sign In", and "Try Demo" buttons

3. Click "Sign In" or navigate to http://localhost:5173/login
4. Use demo credentials or click "Quick Demo Login"
5. You should be successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Better User Experience:**
   - Landing page is now the first thing users see
   - Authenticated users are automatically redirected to dashboard
   - Clear separation between public and protected routes

2. **Port Configuration:**
   - Avoided Windows reserved port range (5000-5004)
   - Using port 5001 which is reliably available

3. **Navigation Flow:**
   - Unauthenticated: Landing → Login → Dashboard
   - Authenticated: Automatically redirected to Dashboard from Landing

## Notes

- The backend server must be running on port 5001 for the frontend to work
- MongoDB must be running locally on port 27017
- Both servers are currently running and ready to use
